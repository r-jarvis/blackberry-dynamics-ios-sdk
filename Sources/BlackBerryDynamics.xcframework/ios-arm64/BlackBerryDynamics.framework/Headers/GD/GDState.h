/** BlackBerry Dynamics run-time state.
 *
 * This class represents a number of aspects of the BlackBerry Dynamics run-time
 * state. The representation is compliant with key-value observing (KVO). An
 * instance of this class is also used as the object from which notifications of
 * configuration changes are posted.
 * 
 * The following aspects of run-time state are represented here.
 * - Authorization state.
 * - Whether the BlackBerry Dynamics user interface is currently in front of the
 *   application user interface.
 * .
 *
 * Changes to the following types of configuration are posted from here.
 * - Services-related, see under \reflink GDiOS::getServiceProvidersFor:andVersion:andServiceType: getServiceProvidersFor: (GDiOS) \endlink.
 * - Application-specific policy settings, see
 *   \reflink GDiOS::getApplicationPolicy getApplicationPolicy (GDiOS) \endlink.
 * - Entitlement, see
 *   \reflink GDiOS::getEntitlementVersionsFor:callbackBlock: getEntitlementVersionsFor:callbackBlock: (GDiOS) \endlink.
 * - Other settings from the enterprise, see
 *   \reflink GDiOS::getApplicationConfig getApplicationConfig (GDiOS) \endlink.
 * .
 *
 * <h2>Synchronous access and notifications</h2>
 * To get a current state synchronously, read the instance's properties. To
 * receive a notification whenever an aspect of the current state changes, use
 * KVO or NSNotificationCenter programming interfaces, with the following notes.
 *
 * Notes on KVO usage:
 * - To get an object whose properties are suitable for observing, access the
 *   \reflink GDiOS::state state (GDiOS) \endlink property.
 * - Use the \ref gdstateconstants to specify the paths of properties of the
 *   observable object.
 * .
 *
 * Notes on <tt>NSNotificationCenter</tt> usage:
 * - Set the notification name to one of the \ref gdstateconstants.
 * - Set the notification object to the GDState instance that is accessible
 *   as the \reflink GDiOS::state state (GDiOS) \endlink property.
 * - In addition to the base NSNotification, the notifications for state changes
 *   will include a <tt>userInfo</tt> dictionary with the following items.
 *   - Name of the property whose change triggered the notification, in the
 *     key named by the <tt>GDStateChangeKeyProperty</tt> constant.
 *   - Copy of the <tt>GDSt</tt><tt>ate</tt> instance as it was after the
 *     change, in the key named by the <tt>GDStateChangeKeyCopy</tt> constant.
 *   .
 * .

 *
 * <h2>Alternatives</h2>
 * Using this class is an alternative to using some parts of using the \link
 * GDiOSDelegate \endlink class.
 *
 * If the application uses this class to monitor authorization, and doesn't
 * implement <tt>GDiOSD</tt><tt>elegate</tt>, then the BlackBerry Dynamics event
 * receiver check must be switched off. Instructions for switching off are on
 * the \ref BuildTimeConfiguration page, under the Event Receiver Check heading.
