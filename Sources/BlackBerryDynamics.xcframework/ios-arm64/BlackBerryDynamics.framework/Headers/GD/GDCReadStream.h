/** NSInputStream subclass for reading files that are in the secure store.
 * 
 * This class is a subclass of the native <tt>NSInputStream</tt> class, for
 * access to the BlackBerry Dynamics secure file system.
 *
 * @see \reflink  GDFileManager \endlink
 * @see \link GDFileHandle \endlink
 *
 * <h2>Programming Interface</h2>
 * This class supports the <tt>read</tt> and <tt>hasBytesAvailable</tt> member
 * functions of <tt>NSInputStream</tt>. This class doesn't support
 * <tt>getBuffer</tt>, which will always return <tt>NO</tt>. This class also
 * doesn't support <tt>scheduleInRunLoop</tt> nor <tt>removeFromRunLoop</tt>.
 * Support for run loops isn't required because the file data can be read
 * immediately.
 *
 * This documentation includes only additional operations provided by
 * GDCReadStream that aren't part of <tt>NSInputStream</tt>.
 *
 * \par Notes on use of the read function
 * The <tt>read</tt> function in this class will work best when the supplied
 * buffer is a multiple of 16 bytes in length. The <tt>maxLength</tt> parameter
 * should reflect the size of the buffer, and not the amount of data remaining
 * to be read from the file. To read a particular number of bytes, <em>B</em>,
 * supply a buffer whose size is <em>B </em>rounded up to the next multiple of
 * 16.\n
 * The return value of the <tt>read</tt> function must always be checked by the
 * application. It mustn't be assumed that a file has been completely read into
 * a buffer, even if the buffer is large enough to accomodate the whole file.
 *
 * The functions in this class utilize <tt>NSError</tt> in a conventional way. Function calls accept as a parameter the location of a pointer to <tt>NSError</tt>, i.e. a pointer to a pointer, with type <tt>NSError**</tt>. The location may be <tt>nil</tt>. If the location isn't <tt>nil</tt>, and an error occurs, the BlackBerry Dynamics runtime overwrites the pointer at the specified location with the address of an object that describes the error that occurred.
 *
