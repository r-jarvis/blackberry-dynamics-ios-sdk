/** Class for BlackBerry Analytics and BlackBerry Persona
 *
 * <h3>BlackBerry Analytics </h3>
* 
* BlackBerry Analytics provides developers and UEM administrators metrics about the BlackBerry Dynamics 
* apps and devices in an organization's environment. BlackBerry Dynamics apps with this feature enabled 
* by their administrator will periodically send events (including startup, crash information) and data 
* (including OS, minutes used, app name, version) to the BlackBerry Analytics platform. The BlackBerry 
* Analytics platform processes and compiles the events and data into dashboard reports. 
* An app developer can optionally use this programmatic interface to record usage of custom features or 
* events within their app to enable these metrics to be included within the Analytics dashboard. 
* 
* For more information, see the <a href="https://docs.blackberry.com/en/endpoint-management/blackberry-analytics" target="_blank">BlackBerry Analytics documentation</a>.
*
*
* <h3>BlackBerry Persona</h3>
* 
* BlackBerry Persona processes events and location data from BlackBerry Dynamics apps to 
* assess a user’s security risk level based on their real-world context, and adjusts the user’s device 
* and app behavior based on their current risk level. For example, if a user’s app data reports a 
* geographic location that is not typical for the user, BlackBerry Persona can dynamically 
* limit the user’s access to work apps or disable certain device features such as the camera. In addition,
* it can be configured by the enterprise administrator to enforce stricter authentication requirements 
* by applying an override policy.
*
* This service requires enabling and configuration by the enterprise administrator. In addition, application 
* developers are required to perform steps to enable BlackBerry Persona.
* 
* <h4>Enabling BlackBerry Persona</h4>
*
* Implement these step to enable Persona within a BlackBerry Dynamics application.
*
*
*
*
* 1. Add the following custom properties to the <tt>Info</tt> section of your project target in Xcode. The resulting <tt>Info.plist</tt> file should contain:
*
* \code 
* <dict>
*   <key>BlackBerryDynamics</key>
*   <dict>
*     <key>EnableBlackBerryPersona</key>
*     <true/>
*   </dict>
* </dict>
* \endcode
*
* 2. Add a setting in the application user interface for end users to enable or disable BlackBerry Persona. 
*
* This setting should ideally be implemented within the 'Settings' or 'Preferences' section of your application's user interface.  
* When the user selects a menu item called 'BlackBerry Persona Settings' the application should call the method 
* BAFBlackberryAnalytics.displaySISsettings.
* This triggers the runtime to display a settings screen which provides the user the 
* option to opt in or out of using location based information when assessing their current risk level. This is a legal 
* requirement to ensure end users are able to opt out of location data collection at any time. It is best practice to 
* only show this option to users who have BlackBerry Persona enabled by their administrator, see  
* BAFBlackberryAnalytics.isSISenabled.
* 
* For more information, see the <a href="https://docs.blackberry.com/en/cylance-and-security/blackberry-persona-uem" target="_blank">BlackBerry Persona documentation</a>.

/**

* to confirm their identity, or by applying predefined policy.
 *
