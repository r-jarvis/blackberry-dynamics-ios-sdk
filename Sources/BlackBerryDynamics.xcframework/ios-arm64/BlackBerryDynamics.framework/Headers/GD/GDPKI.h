/** X.509 Public Key Certificate.
 * 
 * Objects of this class are used to represent X.509 public key
 * certificates in the BlackBerry Dynamics secure store. Certificates in the
 * store could be used as part of integration with an enterprise public key
 * infrastructure.
 *
 * The properties of this class correspond to the standard fields of an X.509
 * public key certificate.
 *
 * @see <a
            href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3280"
            target="_blank"
        >RFC 3280</a> and <a

 *
 * <h2>Public Key Infrastructure Integration</h2>
 * BlackBerry Dynamics can be integrated into a public key
 * infrastructure (PKI) implementation. BlackBerry Dynamics has a number of
 * capabilities for handling the X.509 public key certificates that would be
 * associated with an end user within an enterprise PKI implementation.
 *
 * <h2>Certificate Store Notifications</h2>
 * The BlackBerry Dynamics runtime maintains a secure certificate store on the
 * device. The application code can be notified when certificates are added to,
 * and removed from, the secure certificate store.
 *
 * The typical usage of the notification interface is as follows.
 * -# The application code
 *    implements and adds a notification observer, using the native
 *    <tt>NSNotificationCenter</tt> programming interface.
 * -# When the BlackBerry Dynamics runtime adds an X.509 certificate to its
 *    store, a notification is dispatched to the
 *    observer. The notification includes a
 *    reference to an object that represents the certificate.
 * -# The application code in the observer extracts
 *    the certificate object from the notification.
 * -# The application code can read the object properties to determine the
 *    characteristics of the certificate.
 * .
 * The available notifications are:
 * - \ref GDPKINotificationCertificateAdded for when a certificate is added to
 *   the BlackBerry Dynamics certificate store.
 * - \ref GDPKINotificationCertificateRemoved for when a certificate is removed
 *   from the BlackBerry Dynamics certificate store.
 * .
 *
 * In all cases, the object of the notification will be an instance of this
 * class that represents the certificate.
 *

 * <h2>Code Snippets</h2> The following code snippets illustrate some common tasks.
 * <h3>Certificate Notification Observer</h3>

 *                                              selector:@selector(certificateAdded:)

 * - (void)certificateAdded:(NSNotification *)nsNotification {
 *     GDPKICertificate *gdPKICertificate = nsNotification.object;
 *     SecCertificateRef secCertificate =
 *         SecCertificateCreateWithData(NULL, gdPKICertificate.binaryX509DER);
 *     CFStringRef secCertificateSummary =
 *         SecCertificateCopySubjectSummary(secCertificate);

 * The above snippet shows:
 * - Registration for notification of certificate addition and removal. The
 *   observer code is specified by selector.
 * - Dummy implementation of the certificate added listener that:
 *   - Logs one field directly from the notification object, which is a
 *     BlackBerry Dynamics representation of a certificate.
 *   - Creates a native representation of the same certificate, and logs another
 *     field from it.
 *   .
 * - Dummy implementation of the certificate removed listener that logs one
 *   X.509 field.
