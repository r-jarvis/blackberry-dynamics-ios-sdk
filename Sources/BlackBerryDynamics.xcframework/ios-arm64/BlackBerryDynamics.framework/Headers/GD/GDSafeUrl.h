    /**
    Check that URLs are safe using BlackBerry Protect (C++). 

    BlackBerry Protect uses a combination of cloud and on-device based AI and machine learning to identify malware and unsafe URLs. It 
    is integrated into the Dynamics HTTP secure communication APIs and when licensed provides protection without further 
    integration being required. 

    If an application wants to check a URL outside of utilizing GDURLLoadingSystem   this 
    class can be used to first confirm if BlackBerry Protect is enabled for the user (SafeUrl::isSafeBrowsingEnabled) 
    and then to check that specific URLs are safe (SafeUrl::checkUrl)

    Caller class needs to implement the callback class and wrap it into shared pointer and pass it as a weak pointer.
    The reference number is optional. These APIs can be called only after SDK has been initialised (i.e. after the authorized event).
     
    The caller can use this API in two modes:
     
    1. One-to-one mode: in this case, you need to have separate callback object (wrapped in a shared pointer) for each URL request. 
    However, this will not scale well.
    2. Dispatch mode: you can keep a single callback object and use a reference number for matching your URLs and results. This will scale well.
     
    Please note that SafeUrl class follows the "Monostate" design pattern, that is - you can create as many instances
    of this class as you wish and all will behave as if they are the same object.
