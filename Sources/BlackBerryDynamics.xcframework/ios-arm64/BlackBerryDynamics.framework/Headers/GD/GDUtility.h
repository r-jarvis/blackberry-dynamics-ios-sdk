/** BlackBerry Dynamics utility for managing authentication tokens and identity.
 * 
 * 
 * <h3>BlackBerry Dynamics Authentication Token Mechanism</h3>
 * The BlackBerry Dynamics authentication token mechanism enables
 * applications to utilize the user identification that takes place during
 * BlackBerry Dynamics authorization processing. This enables an application
 * server at the enterprise to authenticate the user without the need for entry
 * of any additional credentials at the device or desktop.
 * 
 * See below for an overall description of the BlackBerry Dynamics
 * authentication token mechanism. This class includes the programming interface
 * for requesting tokens.
 * 
 * @see \reflink GDiOS::authorize: authorize (GDiOS) \endlink for more details of BlackBerry Dynamics authorization
 *      processing.
 * @see \ref ServerAPIGDAuthToken
 *
 * The BlackBerry Dynamics platform includes rigorous authentication of the end
 * user. This is used when, for example, identifying whether the user is
 * entitled to run the current application, and when applying security policies.
 * 
 * The BlackBerry Dynamics Authentication Token (BlackBerry Dynamics auth)
 * mechanism enables applications to take advantage of the authentication
 * processes of the platform.
 *
 * BlackBerry Dynamics auth tokens can be requested by the application on the
 * device or desktop. A token will only be issued if authorization processing
 * has completed, and the end user's identity has been authenticated.
 *
 * Once a token has been issued, the application can send the token to an
 * application server at the back end. The token can then be checked by the
 * application server, using a verification service provided by the BlackBerry
 * Dynamics infrastructure.
 *
 * The sequence of programming interfaces used in BlackBerry Dynamics auth is as
 * follows.
 * -# The mobile application calls \reflink GDUtility::getGDAuthToken:serverName: getGDAuthToken:serverName \endlink to
 *    request a token.
 * -# All being well, a token is issued and the
 *    \reflink GDAuthTokenDelegate::onGDAuthTokenSuccess: onGDAuthTokenSuccess \endlink callback is
 *    invoked and passed the new token.
 * -# The application sends the token to the application server, using an HTTP
 *    request, socket, or other method. In the same communication, the
 *    application sends the email address or other end user identifier for which
 *    it is activated as a BlackBerry Dynamics application.
 * -# The application server checks that the token is valid by calling the
 *    verification service in the \ref ServerAPIGDAuthToken, hosted by an
 *    enterprise BlackBerry Dynamics server. (The server could be a BlackBerry
 *    Proxy or Good Proxy instance.)
 * -# The response from the verification service includes the end user
 *    identifier, if the token is valid. The application server can check that
 *    the value from the verification service is the same as that originally
 *    sent by the mobile application.
 * .
 * This sequence validates the end user's identity, and the application server
 * can therefore grant access to resources and other permissions.
 *
 * Calling the verification service doesn't cause the token to be consumed.
 *
 * Note that a BlackBerry Dynamics application can obtain the identifier of the
 * end user from the <tt>GDAppConfigKeyUserId</tt> value in the collection
 * returned by the \reflink GDiOS::getApplicationConfig getApplicationConfig (GDiOS) \endlink function. 
 * 
 * <h3>Challenge Strings</h3>
 * A <em>challenge string </em>can be included in a BlackBerry Dynamics auth
 * token request. The same challenge string will then be provided to the
 * application server, in the response from the verification service.
 *
 * The challenge string could have a number of uses for application developers.
 * A typical usage could be to tie an instance of authentication to a previous
 * access request, as follows:
 * -# A mobile application attempts to access a resource on an application
 *    server.
 * -# The application server generates a random challenge string.
 * -# The application server responds to the mobile application with a denial of
 *    access message that includes the random challenge string.
 * -# The mobile application requests a BlackBerry Dynamics auth token, and
 *    passes the value from the denial of access message as the challenge
 *    string.
 * -# The mobile application again attempts to access the resource on the
 *    application server, but this time includes the BlackBerry Dynamics auth
 *    token in the request.
 * -# The application server sends the token to the verification service, which
 *    responds that the token is valid. The response includes the challenge
 *    string.
 * -# The application server checks that the challenge string from the
 *    verification service is the same as the random challenge string initially
 *    sent to the mobile application in the denial of access message.
 * .
 * In the above, a new random challenge string is generated on every resource
 * access attempt. This has the effect of making the BlackBerry Dynamics auth
 * tokens one-use. A more advanced algorithm might be to store the token and
 * challenge string in the server, as a session identifier. To end a session,
 * the server could delete the stored token and challenge string, effectively
 * forcing the application to generate a new token, based on a new challenge
 * string, when it next connected.
 * 
 * The verification service provides the challenge string to the application
 * server in an HTTP header, which limits the character set that can be utilized
 * safely. All letters and numerals in the ASCII range 32 to 126 can be utilized
 * safely. Use of other characters isn't supported.
 * 

 * <h3>BlackBerry Dynamics Shared User Identifier</h3>
 * The BlackBerry Dynamics Shared User ID is a unique identifier for all containers which are provisioned for the same user on the same device.
 *
 * <h4>Identifier characteristics</h4>
 *
 * - The identifier is available once a user has authorized / unlocked the container.
 * - The identifier is the same for applications activated against the same user, on the same UEM domain and on the same device, even if authentication delegation (SSO) is enabled.
 * - The identifier doesn't persist once the last Dynamics application is uninstalled from a device or the device is reset.
 * - The identifier is only available for applications activated against a UEM. (Not standalone GC)
 *
 * <h4>Shared Identifier limitations</h4>
 * Shared identifier will not be shared among applications from different keychain groups
