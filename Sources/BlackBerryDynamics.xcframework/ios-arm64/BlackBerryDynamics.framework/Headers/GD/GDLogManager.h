/** BlackBerry Dynamics log manager.
 *
 * This class contains a number of programming interfaces for managing
 * BlackBerry Dynamics activity logs.
 *
 * The BlackBerry Dynamics runtime logs its activity to files in the secure
 * store on the device. The application can use the programming interface in
 * this class to:
 * - Initiate upload of activity log files to a central server.
 * - Show a BlackBerry Dynamics user interface for monitoring the upload
 *   process.
 * - Implement a custom user interface for monitoring the upload process.
 * - Switch on detailed logging, if allowed by enterprise policies.
 * .
 *
 * <h2>Notifications for user interface update</h2>
 * In the case that the application implements a custom user interface, it can
 * be notified of progress by the BlackBerry Dynamics runtime. A notification
 * will be dispatched by the runtime when there is any change to the upload
 * state, or to the amount of data uploaded. For example, a notification would
 * be dispatched when:
 * - Log upload has finished.
 * - The number of bytes sent so far has increased.
 * .
 *
 * When a notification is received, the application code could determine the new
 * status and then update the user interface accordingly, for example:
 * - Update a progress bar to reflect the new number of bytes sent.
 * - Show or hide an option for the end user to cancel upload, based on
 *   whether there is an upload in progress.
 * .
 *
 * The following mechanisms are supported for notifications.
 * - Key-value observing (KVO).
 * - The <tt>NSNotificationCenter</tt> programming interface.
 * .
 * To use KVO, observe the properties of the GDLogManager interface object,
 * which is a singleton. The properties to observe are:
 * - GDLogManager.uploadState
 * - GDLogManager.uploadBytesSent
 * - GDLogManager.uploadBytesTotal
 * .
 * To use <tt>NSNotificationCenter</tt>:
 * - Set the notification name to the \ref GDLogUploadNotification value.
 * - Set the notification object to the \ref GDLogManager object, obtained by
 *     <tt>[G<tt></tt>DLogManager sharedInstance]</tt>.
 * - The posted notifications won't have a <tt>userInfo</tt> dictionary.
 * .
 *
 * @see <a
      HREF="https://developer.apple.com/reference/foundation/nsnotificationcenter"
      target="_blank">NSNotificationCenter class reference</a> in the Apple API
      Reference on the apple.com developer website.

      target="_blank">Key-Value Observing Programming Guide</a> on the apple.com
      developer website.
 *
 * Implementation of an observer of log upload notifications is only required if
 * the application has its own monitoring user interface. It should be easier to
 * display the built-in monitoring user interface, by calling the
 * GDLogManager.openLogUploadUI: function.
 * 
 * @see \ref logging.

/** Switch on detailed activity logging in the BlackBerry Dynamics Runtime.
 * 
 * Call this function to switch on detailed logging by the

 *
 * The runtime writes more messages to its activity log if detailed logging
 * is switched on. Detailed logging slows down the runtime, and increases the
 * amount of device storage occupied by the activity logs in the secure store.
 * For these reasons, detailed logging can only be switched on by the
 * application for a specified duration, and there is a maximum allowed
 * duration. The maximum duration is 15 minutes and is given by the
 * \reflink GDLogManager::GDLogManagerDetailedMaximumDuration GDLogManager::GDLogManagerDetailedMaximumDuration \endlink constant.
 *
 * Detailed activity logging can also be switched on by the BlackBerry Dynamics
 * management console, in which there are a number of options. Check the user
 * interface and documentation of the management console for details.
 *
 * The ability to switch on detailed logging from the application code can be
 * blocked by enterprise policy. See the
 * <tt>GDAppConfigKeyPreventUserDetailedLogs</tt> item in the collection
 * returned by the \reflink GDiOS::getApplicationConfig getApplicationConfig (GDiOS) \endlink function.
 *
