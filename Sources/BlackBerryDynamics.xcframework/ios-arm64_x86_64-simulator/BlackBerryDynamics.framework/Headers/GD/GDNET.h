 * \brief NSURLCache category with additional features.
 * 
 * This class is a category of the native <tt>NSURLCache</tt> class that adds
 * the \ss_functions documented below to the interface. The additional
 * \ss_functions can be used when the BlackBerry Dynamics proxy infrastructure
 * is in use in the
 * \if iOS
 * URL Loading System, see \ref GDURLLoadingSystem, or in the URL session
 * system, see \ref nsurlsession_support.
 * \else
 * URL Loading System, see \ref GDURLLoadingSystem.
 * \endif
 *
 * This class provides additional features to the default cache.
 *
 * This documentation includes only additional operations that are not part
 * of the default <tt>NSURLCache</tt> interface.
 *
 * Note that the additional features cannot be used when the BlackBerry Dynamics
 * proxy infrastructure isn't in use, even if temporarily. If the functions are
 * called in this state, they have no effect.
 *
 * @see <a
 *   href="https://developer.apple.com/reference/foundation/nsurlcache?language=objc"
