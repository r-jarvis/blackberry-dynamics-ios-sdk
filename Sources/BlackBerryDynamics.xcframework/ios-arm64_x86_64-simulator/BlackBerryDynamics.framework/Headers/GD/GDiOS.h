 * \snippet{Authorization}
 * The following snippet shows initiation of BlackBerry Dynamics authorization.
 * \code
 * [GDiOS sharedInstance].delegate = self;
 * [[GDiOS sharedInstance] authorize];
 * \endcode
 * After executing the above code, the application would wait for its delegate
 * callback to be invoked. The invocation would have an event type of
 * <tt>GDAppEventAuthorized</tt> if the user was authorized. After that, the
 * application could make full use of all BlackBerry Dynamics capabilities.
 *
 * The above code relies on the identification parameters being in the
 * Info.plist file, as shown in the following snippet.
 * \code
 * <key>GDApplicationID</key>
 * <string>com.example.browser</string>
 * <key>GDApplicationVersion</key>
 * <string>1.0.0.0</string>
 * \endcode
 * The above is an extract from the XML of the application's Info.plist file.
 * The extract sets "com.example.browser" as the BlackBerry Dynamics entitlement
 * identifer, and "1.0.0.0" as the BlackBerry Dynamics entitlement version.
 *
 * \snippet{User interface pre-initialization}
 * The following snippet shows some necessary steps that precede initialization
 * of the application's user interface. The recommended place in the code for
 * these steps is as shown in the snippet.
 * \code
 *
 * - (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions
 * { 
 *     GDiOS *gdiOS = [GDiOS sharedInstance];
 *     gdiOS.delegate = self;
 *     started = NO;
 *     // Following line will cause the BlackBerry Dynamics user interface to open.
 *     [gdiOS authorize];
 *     return YES;
 * }
 * \endcode
 *
 * The above snippet shows the following sequence of actions.
 * -# A reference to the GDiOS singleton object is obtained.
 * -# The current class is set as the delegated event handler.
 * -# The <tt>started</tt> flag is set, to control initialization of the
 *    application's user interface, which is covered in the following snippet.
 *    The flag's declaration (not shown) would be <tt>BOOL</tt>.
 * -# The application initiates BlackBerry Dynamics authorization.
 * .
 * Authorization processing is asynchronous. On completion, an event will be
 * dispatched to the application's handler. The application completes user
 * interface initialization within its event handler, as shown in the following
 * code snippet.
 *
 * \snippet{User interface initialization}
 * The following snippet shows the recommended place in the code to initialize
 * the application's user interface.
 * \code
 *
 * -(void)handleEvent:(GDAppEvent*)anEvent
 * {
 *     switch (anEvent.type) {
 *         case GDAppEventAuthorized: {
 *             if (!started) {
 *                 [self initializeUI];
 *                 started = YES;
 *             }
 *             break;
 *         }
 *
 *         case GDAppEventNotAuthorized: {
 *             [self onNotAuthorized:anEvent];
 *             break;
 *         }
 *
 *         case GDAppEventRemoteSettingsUpdate:
 *         case GDAppEventServicesUpdate:
 *         case GDAppEventPolicyUpdate:
 *         default: {
 *             // This application ignores other types of event.
 *             break;
 *         }
 *     }
 * }
 * \endcode
 * The above code shows a simple BlackBerry Dynamics runtime event handler.
 *
 * The handler calls the application's own <tt>initializeUI</tt> function when a
 * <tt>GDAppEventAuthorized</tt> event is received for the first time. The
 * application's <tt>started</tt> flag is used to control first-time execution.
 * Initialization of this flag is shown in the previous snippet.\n
 * The <tt>initializeUI</tt> function would complete user interface
 * initialization, utilizing a reference to the BlackBerry Dynamics runtime
 * <tt>UIWindow</tt>. This reference can be obtained using the <tt>window</tt>
 * property from the main app delegate.
 *
 * The handler calls the application's own <tt>onNotAuthorized</tt> function
 * whenever a <tt>GDAppEventNotAuthorized</tt> event is received.
