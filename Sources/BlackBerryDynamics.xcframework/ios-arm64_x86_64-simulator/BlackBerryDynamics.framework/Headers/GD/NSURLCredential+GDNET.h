/** Credential persistence.
 * 
 * Set this property of an <tt>NSURLCredential</tt> object to specify the
 * persistence for the credential that it represents. This property can be set
 * on a server trust credential that is created as part of the processing of an
 * <tt>NSURLAuthenticationMethodServerTrust</tt> authentication challenge.
 *
 * The property can be set to one of the following values:
 * - <tt>NSURLCredentialPersistenceNone</tt> Credential won't be stored
 *   persistently.
 * - <tt>NSURLCredentialPersistencePermanent</tt> Credential will be stored
 *   persistently in the application's BlackBerry Dynamics secure store.
 * .
 * 
 * If the credential is stored persistently then it will be reused automatically
 * every time an authentication challenge for the same protection space is
 * received. This means that the following callbacks won't be invoked:
 * - <tt>NSURLConnectionDelegate willSendRequestForAuthenticationChallenge</tt>
 * - <tt>GDURLRequestConnectionDelegate
 *   willSendRequestForAuthenticationChallenge</tt>
 * .
 * 
 * Automatic reuse continues until one of the following occurs:
 * - The server presents different certificate details.
 * - The application cancels persistence, by calling the
 *   <tt>undoPriorTrustDecision</tt> \ss_function.
 * .
 *
 * See the class reference of the \ref NSMutableURLRequest(GDNET) category for
 * details of the <tt>undoPriorTrustDecision</tt> \ss_function.

 * it used for Kerberos authentication.
 *
 * Even if this property is set to \ss_true, a ticket that can be delegated
 * might not be issued. Delegation also depends on configuration in the Kerberos
