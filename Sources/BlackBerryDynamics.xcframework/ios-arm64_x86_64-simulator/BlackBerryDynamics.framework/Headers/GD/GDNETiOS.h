 * <h3>Overview</h3>
 * An instance of this class represents an HTTP request. The programming
 * interface is state-based. The availability of functions to be called by the
 * application at any given time depend on the current state of the request.
 *
 * Requests can be processed synchronously or asynchronously, at the option of
 * the application. For asychronous operation, the application attaches its own
 * event-handler callback to the request object. The callback function is
 * invoked when events occur, or when the request changes state.
 *
 * The callback is attached through a delegate class. Invocation of the callback
 * is detailed in the delegate class's documentation, see GDHttpRequestDelegate.
 *
 * The availability of interface functions, and what actions take place, are
 * detailed below and summarized in the following table. (States in all-capitals
 * are standard XHR ready states.)<table>
